Analyzing optimal data structures and algorithms for Twilio callback system:

1. ARCHITECTURE PATTERNS:
   - Event-driven architecture with webhook handlers
   - Queue-based call management for scalability
   - State machine for call flow management
   - Caching layer for frequently accessed data

2. DATA STRUCTURES:
   - Priority queue for callback scheduling
   - Hash maps for O(1) client lookup
   - Circular buffer for call history
   - B-tree for efficient phone number indexing

3. ALGORITHMS:
   - Exponential backoff for retry logic
   - Load balancing across multiple Twilio numbers
   - Rate limiting with token bucket algorithm
   - A* pathfinding for optimal call routing

4. OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES:
   - Connection pooling for database queries
   - Lazy loading of client data
   - Batch processing for bulk callbacks
   - Memoization for frequently computed values

5. COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:
   - Call initiation: O(1) with proper indexing
   - Queue management: O(log n) with heap structure
   - Client search: O(1) with hash table
   - History retrieval: O(log n) with B-tree index
