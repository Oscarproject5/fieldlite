## Problem Statement

### The Pain Points of Service-Based Businesses

Service-based SMBs face critical operational challenges that prevent growth and profitability:

#### 1. Operational Inefficiency
- **Manual scheduling chaos:** Dispatchers juggle calls, texts, and paper calendars
- **Lost information:** Customer history scattered across notebooks, spreadsheets, and memory
- **Equipment blindspots:** No visibility into which truck has which tools or when maintenance is due
- **Missed appointments:** No automated reminders lead to no-shows and wasted time

#### 2. Growth Bottlenecks
- **Can't scale:** Systems break down when trying to add more crews or equipment
- **Staff coordination nightmares:** Hard to track who's trained on what equipment or certified for specific jobs
- **Cash flow problems:** Delayed invoicing and payment tracking create financial stress
- **Capacity planning guesswork:** No data-driven insights on when to hire or buy equipment

#### 3. Marketing Challenges
- **Lead leakage:** Phone calls and form submissions slip through the cracks
- **No follow-up system:** Estimates sent but never tracked or followed up on
- **Wasted marketing spend:** Can't track which ads or campaigns generate actual revenue
- **Poor customer retention:** No system for proactive maintenance reminders or re-engagement

#### 4. Technology Barriers
- **Complexity overload:** Enterprise CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot) are too complex and expensive
- **Feature mismatch:** General CRMs don't understand field service workflows
- **Integration headaches:** Cobbling together QuickBooks + spreadsheets + sticky notes
- **Mobile gaps:** Office software doesn't work well for field technicians

### The Core Problem

**Service businesses are stuck using tools built for office workers, not field teams. They need a system that understands their unique workflow: from the first phone call, through job scheduling, to completed work and payment—all while helping them grow through better marketing and operations.**
