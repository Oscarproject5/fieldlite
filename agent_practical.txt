Evaluating practical Twilio implementation constraints:

1. INTEGRATION OPTIONS:
   - Twilio Flex for complete contact center (overkill for small CRM)
   - Twilio Voice API with webhooks (best balance)
   - Twilio Functions for serverless (reduced maintenance)
   - Twilio Client SDK for browser calls (good UX)

2. PHONE INTEGRATION METHODS:
   - Call forwarding: Simple but limited control
   - SIP registration: Complex but powerful
   - Twilio mobile SDK: Best for mobile apps
   - Click-to-call web: Most practical for CRM

3. DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Use environment variables for credentials
   - Implement circuit breakers for reliability
   - Add comprehensive logging for debugging
   - Use ngrok for local development/testing

4. COST OPTIMIZATION:
   - Use local numbers when possible (/month vs 5/month toll-free)
   - Implement call duration limits
   - Cache frequently dialed numbers
   - Use Twilio's bundled minutes

5. TEAM REQUIREMENTS:
   - Simple REST API that any developer can use
   - Clear error messages and status codes
   - Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
   - Docker containerization for easy deployment
